# Welcome to my Project 5 page

## Project 5: Optional Extra Credit
- I did not submit a project 5
- This is why there are no additional files uploaded to the repo.

## Overview of what project 5 consisted of:
- "For this project, you will create a Monster Game program using classes. The game will create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. The game will include a delay before each life drain."

## What I would have learned had I done project 5:
- Gained experience working with classes, including class constructors and methods
- Gained experience interpreting existing code to design a new class, including constructor and methods
- Gained more experience working with code modules
- Gained experience executing and debugging Node.js code using VSCode, including module breakpoints
- Gained more experience working with Array map() and forEach() methods
- Gained experience working with the concept of a gaming loop
- Gained more experience working with objects and arrays
